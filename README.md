# Gate Pass - A full stack web application for managing entry/exit of hostel students

**The problem:** In our university campus, the entry and exit of students is still managed by using paper passes and registers. This process is time consuming and needs to be 
modernized. This project aims at demonstrating a digital solution to this process using three components as described below:

### The mobile website for students <a href="https://cugatepass.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">(click to visit)</a>: 
Built using _pure_ HTML/CSS this component (designed for mobile screens only) serves as the main interface for students to request and view gate passes.
The user can login using the credentials which is generated by the warden.

For testing, use this credentials:
Username : `1234`
Password  : `715154`

</p>

Inorder to make a new request for gate pass, the user can click on the `Add new request` button which will lead him/her to the request page. Afer filling in the details, the 
request is validated by an OTP which is sent to the parent's mobile number

On successful submission of request, the user can view the gate pass (QR code based) by simply clicking on the pass:

### The warden's dashboard <a href="https://cugatepass.herokuapp.com/warden" target="_blank">(click to visit)</a>: 

Built using components of BootStrap, this dashboard enables the warden to view, accept and reject gate pass requests. Also  registrations of student accounts is done through
this same portal. A tab named `Late Entry` has been provided on the dashboard which lists all the students who have made a "late entry" in the campus.

In order to login as a test user, use credentials: Username : `testwarden` Password : `62537374`

This is how the dashboard looks like:

### The Android app for Guards (click to download)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/17w5OjVFrWf2mEcgm-mlcr7HZcEyPydNK/view?usp=sharing] : 

Built on [https://kodular.io](kodular.io) (an MIT App Inventor based platform), this app serves as a gatepass/QR code scanner. The UI is very simple and easy to use. On scanning 
the gatepass, the status is automatically updated.

Test user credentials, Username : `testguard` Password : `14631528`
